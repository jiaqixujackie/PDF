I am trying to create an application to do the following:

1. takes in one or more PDF files. For each file: <br/>
2. add a new blank page after every page of the originial file. <br/>
3. save each modified PDF as a new PDF file. <br/>

I will try to write small functions and combine them into a small program later on.
