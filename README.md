I take a lot of notes in class. <br/>
Unfortunately, the space available for note-taking on lecture slides are very limiting. <br/>
Therefore, I decided to create a small python program which allows me to do the following: <br/>


1. takes in one or more PDF files. For each PDF file: <br/>
2. add extra space (see `blankpage.pdf`) on the right side of every page in the existing PDF. <br/>
3. save the modified PDF as a new PDF file. <br/>


You may replace `blankpage.pdf` with any other draft paper  <br/>
• but it need to have portrait orientation must be A4 sized. <br/>
• and you need to name your draft paper as blankpage.pdf. <br/>


You can use this pdf merger in two ways: <br/>
method 1: In `editor.py`, specify a working directory and a PDF file name, then hit run to begin the merge process. <br/>
method 2: In `main.py`, click run, then select multiple PDF files from the same directory to begin the merge process. <br/>
